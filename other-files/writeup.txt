1. What corrections did you have to make?
A: Error from Missing alternative text and Missing form label and one alert from possible heading. There is a HTML5 video or audio alert that we don’t know how to fix. Contrast error (grey color similar to the background and we just follow the example), according to the professor, we don’t need to fix it.

2. Given that the photos and captions rely on user-generated content, do you think that the accessibility problems are all solvable? Why or why not? 

A: No, because sometimes web page is designed to specific purpose. For example, we leave contrast Errors because we think the subline “suggested for you” would better be ignored by users but not being as important as suggested user id and profile pic.

3. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not? 
A: It is still usable because without CSS, the format will be ugly, but the core functional features are still there. CSS contains the format, for example, whether the text position is centered or not. If there is no CSS to help the formatting, the content would not disappear but could possibly just overlap with each other. Under this situation, it is still usable but just very difficult for users to use.

4. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the images? Why or why not?

A: From user side, it is not usable because a photo app without images would no longer be usable. To them, the core feature is being disabled (view posted images) so the website to them is not usable. From developer side, it is still usable because other core features like text posts, able to comment, suggestions, stories are still there. Image places would be white blank or with show some texts to indicate its content. It is still functioning but with awful user experiences.
