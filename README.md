# photo-app

## Part 1: Setup  
  
1. Create two files  
Create a folder called photo-app. Inside of it, create two files â€“ an HTML file called index.html and a CSS file called styles.css.  

2. Create a new GitHub repository  
Log into GitHub and create a new private GitHub repository. Name it photo-app. Please make it private so that others cannot see your code (for academic integrity considerations).
